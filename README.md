# SendGrid

A WordPress-plugin from Webstarters.

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.2
- PHP 7.1

In addition, you must have the necessary credentials to access the SendGrid API.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require webstarters/sendgrid
```

...or download the plugin as a ZIP and upload it via WP-Admin.

### Configuration

You must set `WS_SENDGRID_API_KEY` in your `wp-config.php` with your SendGrid API Key.

You may set a default SendGrid Template ID for all mails via `WS_SENDGRID_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_ID`.

## Usage

This plugin overwrites ```wp_mail``` to send via SendGrid.

You can also send mail via the new ```sendgrid_mail``` method, which extends wp_mail, but adds the possibility of specifying template data and ID.

### Debugging

To begin, enable ```WP_DEBUG``` and ```WP_DEBUG_LOG``` in the ```wp_config.php``` file.

Remember to disable ```WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY``` if the website is in a production environment.
